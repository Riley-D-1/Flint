# Flint
## A flashcard app
An electron/web based FOSS flashcard application to solve the problems of existing flashcard applications. Flint solves the problems like clunky UI, poor offline functionality , lack of data exporting control, paywalls and the printing of flashcards. It will be expanded on to be the best flashcard app out there.

### Please note
- This is my second ever time using JS and my most complex use of CSS and Html ever so please ignore the fact everything took ages.
- The demo is currently  lacking lots of the core ideas and functionality such as printing, saving flashcards
to the web and etc.
- This week (Signal theme week) was only a 8 hour project (mecenaries used cause exams) and is therefore quite lacking
### Showcase of Project

## How to I tick the theme Signal
I created a signal game, that uses flashcards. If you get a flashcard wrong the signal of the flashcard decays (and if your'e really slow you fail). The game is centered around the idea of cell signals. It requires you to do well and not be slow.
Note that it could certainly be improved upon but I simply do not have the time due to exams to improve it.

### Why did I create flint?
I created flint in order to remove the paywall locked features of popular flashcard apps and allow for easier creation of flashcards. I especially wanted to improve on the printing provess of existing flashcard apps which led to the creation of this program.
### Inspiration
- Quizlet
- Anki

### Devlog (See commits)
### Technologies used

### Flashcard shortcut controls
- The controls for the flashcard use the arrow keys
- ➡️ for going to the  next flashcard (or correct) 
- ⬅️ for going back a flashcard (or Wrong)
- ⬆️ or ⬇️ to flip the flashcard and show the otherside
You can of course use the buttons but it saves time using arrow keys.
